## Project Title

Tour de Hops Hiking Trails and Breweries Application

## Description

_Quick description about this project_

- In this project, we set out to design an application that would be a hiking and brewery safehaven for our users. Built upon the user experience with a polished user interface, users can search for hiking trails in our custom made hiking trails database. Also powered by OpenBreweryDB API, we dynamically incorporate user's searched locations to showcase breweries that might match their interests. Welcome to Tour de Hops!

## User Story

_User Story for this Project:_

- As a user, I would like to have an application where I can search up hiking trails in the area of my choice and be able to find information such as hiking difficulty and ratings. I also want to be able to have a refreshing beverage afterwards and be able to search for breweries around the area of my choice. I want to be able to save my favorite trails and breweries.

## Business Context

- Further expansion upon the application could include advertisement to allow local businesses to engage with our users further expanding our mission of a united application for our nature and brewery loving users.
